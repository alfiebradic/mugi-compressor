Mugi Dynamics 4216

Dual-mono multi-band upwards/downwards compressor and saturator.

//==Installation==========

1. Open `MugiDynamics4216.jucer` in Projucer.

2. Create and open IDE project.

3. Navigate to PluginEditor.cpp and change the asset directory paths to those in the  `source` folder.
Attempts were made to change these absolute paths to relative but results were inconsistent. 
It seemed safer to have these manually specified on the local machine.

4. Build plugin for your preferred format.

Happy compressing!
